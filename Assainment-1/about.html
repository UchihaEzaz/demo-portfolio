            <h3>For 75 years, the number “1984” has represented a numerical nightmare. Those four digits have been brandished in screaming headlines, blaring soundbites, a BBC teleplay that resulted in heart attacks and even deaths of viewers (in December 1954), and the Washington hotline of the John Birch Society, the far-right American advocacy group. (“Call 202-659-­[pause]1-­9-­8-­4! NOW!” proclaimed the old JBS ads.)

            Indeed, the world of Oceania in George Orwell’s famous novel is routinely described as diabolical, oppressive, and hopeless, and variously deemed a horror story, an elegy, a threnody, a shriek of terror, a wail of despair, a death cry. Isaac Deutscher, the biographer of both Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin, referred to it in 1955—in the wake of the controversial BBC broadcasts and their “fatal” consequences—as the “Black Millennium,” when George Orwell turned a segment of time forever into charcoal dust. Literary and cultural critics have described 1984—or rather Nineteen Eighty-Four, to use the British title that Orwell himself preferred—as the vengeful death wish of a cynic, the tubercular projection of a dying man, the paranoid fantasy of a writer in despair, the Schadenfreude of a neurotic adult schoolboy who sent the entire world to room 101, and a totalitarian tract devised as a desperate invalid’s futile protest against the specter of totalitarianism, whether in the form of Hitler’s on the right or Stalin’s on the left.
                
            Nineteen Eighty-Four is none of these.
                
            Rather, it is instead an affirming flame, even an optimistic vision of a hope-filled time just over the horizon.
                
            How and why have critics and readers so misunderstood Nineteen Eighty-Four?
                
            To answer that question fully, we need to look at both textual and contextual issues, moving back and forth between intrinsic and extrinsic considerations. The contextual and extrinsic issues have to do with Orwell’s life and the world of the 1940s. We need to interrogate the casual assertion, congealed into hardened biographical myth in the popular consciousness, that a tubercular George Orwell, struggling with an agonizing disease and the tragic death of his wife and a Europe overshadowed by totalitarians of the right and left, labored under an ever-lengthening shadow, giving rise to a darkened vision and ultimately a bleak pessimism. He despaired of his own life and lost hope, too, in humanity’s future.</h3>

            <h3>The textual and intrinsic reasons have to do with the awful progress of the novel into Part Three and the Ministry of Love—and the annihilation of Winston Smith as a thinking being (“The Last Man in Europe”), whose fully dehumanized end as a brainwashed zombie is summed up in the sentence “He loved Big Brother.”

            That is the takeaway “nightmare” ending that has long disposed readers and critics to judge Nineteen Eighty-Fouras a dystopia of absolute negation. As Irving Howe wrote in his influential essay in the American Scholar, “History as Nightmare” (1956), which became the closing chapter of his classic study Politics and the Novel (1957):
                
            1984 brings us to the end of the line. Beyond this—one feels or hopes—it is impossible to go.
                
            By that sentence, Howe meant not only “impossible to go” in terms of human suffering and the destruction of identity but also aesthetically: the modern novel had reached its limit. Orwell had taken a long step beyond Stendhal’s The Charterhouse of Parma, Dostoevsky’s The Possessed, Conrad’s Under Western Eyes, Malraux’s Man’s Fate, and other visions of political tragedy and madness. Orwell’s nightmarish novel represented the end of History, a raven-black fantasia: beyond the totalitarian violence of and digitized dumbing-down evinced in Nineteen Eighty-Four, the fictional imagination could find no expression in art or literature that could be realized.
                
            “The End” is not, however, the end. The ending of the main text does not actually close the novel. It includes an appendix, titled “The Principles of Newspeak.”</h3>
